## Target Audience
- Gift Giver (Primary User)
- Gift Recipient (Secondary User)
  
PresentPal caters to two key groups in the gift-giving process. The primary users are busy gift-givers, often balancing work and family, who want to organise their holiday shopping efficiently. They use the platform to create gift lists, track recipients, and monitor their shopping progress, reducing stress and last-minute hassles.

The secondary users are gift recipients, who can join in by creating their own wishlists when invited by a gift-giver. This collaborative approach ensures gifts are thoughtful and easier to choose, while still keeping the surprise alive during the holiday season.
